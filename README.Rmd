The goal of testextra is to facilitate extraction of tests embedded in source code.

## Installation

You will be able to install the released version of testextra from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) once it is released with:

``` r
install.packages("testextra")
```

Until then or if you wish to get the latest version prior to release you may install directly from github with:

```r
remotes::install_github("RDocTaskForce/testextra")
```


## Including Tests in Source Code.

To include tests in source code put your tests following the function definition nested in an
`if(FALSE){...}` block and tag it with a `#@testing` block tag.

```r
#' Hello World Example
hello_world <- function(){
    message("hello world!")
}
if(FALSE){#@testing
    expect_message(hello_world(), "hello world!")
}
```

Assuming the preceeding code is in a package file `./R/hello_world.R` running the 
`extract_tests()` command will create a file `./tests/testthat/test-hello_world.R`
with the contents as below.

```r
#! This file was automatically produced by the testextra package.
#! Changes will be overwritten.

context('tests extracted from file `hello_world.R`')
#line 5 "./R/hello_world.R"
test_that('hello_world', {#@testing
    expect_message(hello_world(), "hello world!")
})
```

When run, if there are error messages, the line given will be the line and file 
from the original source code.

## Combination Functions

The functions `test()` and `test_file()` provided in `testextra` will both extract 
tests from source files and run said tests outputing the results.
`test()` operates on a package as a whole or a subsetof a package by setting the 
filter argument, see the help file for details.
`test_file()` is intended to work with the [Rstudio](http://rstudio.com) GUI.
It takes the currently selected file, extracts tests and runs the tests. 
This way a tests may be run only for the current file being evaluated.

Both `test()` and `test_file()` are available through the addins, and 
made accessible through the menu of Rstudio.

## Other Helpers

The 'testextra` package provides a number of useful testing functions to use
when testing code.

### Inheritance

* **`all_inherit()`** - tests if all elements of a list are of the given class or classes.
* **`are()`** - similar to `all_inherit()`, however uses the `is()` mechanism which is more
              appropriate for S4 classes.
* **`is_exactly()`** - Tests if an object is a class, but disallows inheritance. 
* **`all_are_exactly()`** - The `is_exactly()` test vectorized over a list of objects.

### Strings

* **`is_nonempty_string()`** - similar to `asssertthat::is.string()` but also ensures
                               that the provided string is not missing (`NA`) and not empty (`""`)
* **`is_optional_string()`** - same as `is_nonempty_string()` except does allow a character vector 
                               of length 0.
                               
### Validity

* **`is_valid()`** - Performs `validObject()` in a manner that is compatible with                  
                  `validate_that()`, `assert_that()`, or `see_if()` from the 
                  `assertthat` package.
* **`are_valid()`** - `is_valid()` over a list, which when used with the functions listed above
                    gives the indices of objects that are not valid.
* **`expect_valid()`** - Check validity which is to be used with the `testthat` framework.

### Namespaces

When testing dynamic class creation and modification, it is often necessary to have a 
package environment other that the package environment in which the creation functions
are defined.  For this purpose, `testextra` provides these namespace manipulation functions.

* **`new_namespace_env()`** - Create a namespace environment.
    *Similar functionality exists in `pkgload`, but is not exposed and registers the 
     namespace by default, which `new_namespace_env()` does not. 
* **`new_pkg_environment()`** - Create a package environment.  Technically a namespace
    does not have to be a package environment, however that is essentially always the case.
    This function does allow for registration of the environment as a namespace but does not
    do so by default.
* **`register_namespace`** - Explicitly register a previously created namespace.
* **`is_namespace_registered`** - Check if a namespace is registered.

### Others

A few other helpers that do not fit into one of the above categories.

* **`catch_condition()`** - Evaluates code and captures any signals that may be raised.
        Useful for capturing and subsequently running multiple tests on the error captured, 
        as an alternative to `expect_error()`, `expect_warning()`, and `expect_message()`
        from the `testthat` package. 
* **`class0`** - retrieve the class of an object as a single string.  Separates elements by a '/' 
        if there are more than one. *Same functionality as the `knitr::klass()` function.*
* **`is_valid_regex`** - Check if a regular expression is valid, not that it does what is intended
        just that it is valid.
